<h1 align="center"> Hi!üëã WELCOME TO REST ASSURED API AUTOMATION TESTING PROJECT </h1>
<p align="left">

*Hello Everyone, In this project I used the RESTASSURED as a REpresentational STATE TRANSFER and JAVA as a language.
Then, I tested the [REQ_RES](https://reqres.in/), [USER_API_DATABASE](http://localhost:3000) and I created local
JSON-server which has the resources and its JSON data and I validate all the HTTP Methods on the Json data like GET,
POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, DELAY, COPY, LINK, UNLINK, LOCK, UNLOCK, HEAD, VIEW.*
