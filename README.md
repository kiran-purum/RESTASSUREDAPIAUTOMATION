<h1 align="center"> Hi!üëã WELCOME TO REST ASSURED API AUTOMATION TESTING PROJECT </h1>
<p align="left">

---

*Hello Everyone, In this project I used the RESTASSURED as a REpresentational STATE TRANSFER and JAVA as a language.
Then, I tested the [REQ_RES](https://reqres.in/), [USER_API_DATABASE](http://localhost:3000) and I created local
JSON-server which has the resources and its JSON data, and I validate all the HTTP Methods on the Json data GET, POST,
PUT, PATCH, DELETE. Then, I created a Local_API
using [JSON_SERVER](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started)
it will create a local database with data. Then, I validate the json schema and then created Extent Reports can refer to
this [ExtentReports](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ok7C7Yn9A-yUEnE62gOQ2B4pL3gsC28)
and Created using testNg.xml file will run parallel Execution all test cases, can refer to
this [TestNG.xml](https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml)
file to execute all the test cases in every class.*
